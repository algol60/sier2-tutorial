Tutorial part 3 - GUI
=====================

In this tutorial, we'll build on the dag we build previously to provide
a GUI interface. We'll be using ``panel``, an open-source Python library
designed to streamline the development of robust tools, dashboards,
and complex applications entirely within Python.

There are a couple of ways of adding a ``panel`` user interface.
One is to subclass ``UserInput`` and add the ``panel`` code in the subclass.
This has the advantage of keeping the functionality and the user interface
separated from each other, and makes unit testing of the functionality simpler.
On the other hand, for the sake of simplicity, we'll just directly add
the ``panel`` code to the block class.

Adding a panel interface is simple: just add a ``__panel__()`` method
that returns a ``panel`` component. We won't explain the ``panel`` code
here, see the `panel web site <https://panel.holoviz.org>`_ for more information.

The ``__panel__()`` method creates a text area and a checkbox.

We've made another change to the ``UserInput`` block. Because this block will
be waiting for user input, it inherits from the :class:`sier2.InputBlock`.
This won't have any effect in this tutorial, but it will in the next one.

We can test this panel by displaying it. In the directory above the ``tutorials``
directory, run python to get a REPL prompt and enter these commands.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> import tutorials.tutorial_3a as t3a
    >>> ui = t3a.UserInput()
    >>> ui
    UserInput(_block_state=<BlockState.READY: 2>, name='UserInput00882', out_flag=False, out_text='The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog.\n\nThe end.')
    >>> ui.__panel__().show(threaded=True)

This instantiates a ``UserInput`` block and displays its default value,
including the params. It then calls the ``__panel__()``
method to get a panel component, and calls ``show()``. The input component
is displayed in your browser. The ``panel`` library is aware of ``param`` parameters;
we make use of this to create ``panel`` widgets that automatically update
their corresponding params.

Change the text and set the flag, then go back to the Python REPL and Ctrl-C the Panel server, and look at the value of ``ui`` again.

.. code-block:: python

    >>> ui
    UserInput(_block_state=<BlockState.READY: 2>, name='UserInput00882', out_flag=True, out_text='New text.')

Because the panel widgets automatically update the param values, we can see the new
values of ``out_text`` and ``out_flag``.

We've set the out params, but instead of setting them in Python like
the previous tutorials, we've presented a UI to the user and let the UI set
the params depending on what the user does. However, if you'd
like to test your block in a Python script, or in a ``pytest`` unit test,
you can still just set the out params as before.

After adding ``__panel__()`` methods to the other blocks, we can
test our dag.

As before, we create instances of our blocks and build a dag.
This time, we create a ``pn.Column()`` containing the blocks and
``show()`` it.

.. note::

    To see this dag in action, run ``tutorials/tutorial_3b.py``.

However, we have a problem: there's no way to execute the dag.
We can't call ``dag.execute()`` because we're running a panel server,
and we want to wait for the user to provide input.

We'll see how to fix that in the next tutorial.
